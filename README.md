# repometrics.github.io
Group 10 Assignment 8

To view this webite, you must download and host the repo on your local machine.  Since the augur API does not use HTTPS, Github will not allow calls to it, and therefore no visualizations will appear.  After "Get Repo" is clicked, it may take several seconds for the drop down menu to populate while the API call processes.  If a reed error appears, it is because the API call returned no data.
