# repometrics.github.io
Group 10 Assignment 8

To view this website, you must download and host the repo on your local machine.  Since the augur API does not use HTTPS, Github will not allow calls to it, and therefore no visualizations will appear.  After "Get Repo" is clicked, it may take several seconds for the drop down menu to populate while the API call processes.  If a red error appears, it is because the API call returned no data.

Contributions:
Michelle = Front end, created html and css files for each web page and their graphs
Samantha = Back end, created js files to make appropriate api calls and dynamically populate the graphs and selection options
